# Old MacDonald's Farm for Bewildered Furries

## Overview

Old McDonald (OMD) had a website... And on this website they DIDN'T have a plan to implement responsive design!! OMD would like to hire YOU to fix the prob!!

## Scope of work

### Task 1: Centering 
The page content needs to be centered using a container div (note that these are not the same as flexbox containers). The maximum width the page content should get to is 1280px and be set in the middle.

Make sure that your screen is actually bigger than 1280px by typing `window.innerWidth` into the console and hitting return.

As per <https://codepen.io/jmsherry/pen/LGvNPw>, you will write one rule for elements with a class of container and you may insert those divs INSIDE landmark elements, like the `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc. (We do that so we can put a background on the header/footer that goes to the edge of the page whilst using the containers to center/restrict the width of its content)

Also, it's usual for text to be centered on mobile devices and left-aligned on desktop. Please add relevant rules & media queries to achieve this.


### Task 2: Re-factoring existing code

Some of the content has been written 'desktop first'. You'll need to use media queries and re-arrange when the widths are set so that it responds


### Task 3: Add your own responsive code

Add a section where the goths are 4 across on desktop; 2 accross on tablet and stacked on mobile
